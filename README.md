ds# 🧠 Cortex Linux
### The AI-Native Operating System

**Linux that understands you. No documentation required.**
```bash
$ cortex install oracle-23-ai --optimize-gpu
🧠 Analyzing system: NVIDIA RTX 4090 detected
   Installing CUDA 12.3 + dependencies
   Configuring Oracle for GPU acceleration  
   Running validation tests
✅ Oracle 23 AI ready at localhost:1521 (4m 23s)
```

## The Problem

Installing complex software on Linux is broken:
- 47 Stack Overflow tabs to install CUDA drivers
- Dependency hell that wastes days
- Configuration files written in ancient runes
- "Works on my machine" syndrome

**Developers spend 30% of their time fighting the OS instead of building.**

## The Solution

Cortex Linux embeds AI at the operating system level. Tell it what you need in plain English—it handles everything:

- **Natural language commands** → System understands intent
- **Hardware-aware optimization** → Automatically configures for your GPU/CPU
- **Self-healing configuration** → Fixes broken dependencies automatically
- **Enterprise-grade security** → AI actions are sandboxed and validated

## Status: Early Development

**Seeking contributors.** If you've ever spent 6 hours debugging a failed apt install, this project is for you.

## Current Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
